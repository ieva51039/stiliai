    <p>AlphaGo has won the first two matches. In this, the third in our series on the epic Go matches being played between AlphaGo (Google’s Artificial Intelligence software) and Lee Se-Dol (Current Go World Champion), we look at the history of Humans vs. Machines, and the innovations that have led us to this incredible moment in time.</p>

    For as long as humans have built things, we’ve wrestled with the implications of what we’ve built. In many cases, these philosophical and ethical wrestlings have made for great drama—think Frankenstein, or 2001: A Space Odyssey. Often, the hypothetical scenarios we envision come remarkably close to true, and the discoveries we’ve made in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning make clear that a “computer with a mind of its own” such a fantastic thing to imagine any longer.</p>

  <body style="background-color: powderblue; color: blue;"> Perhaps this is why we are so captivated by human vs.</body> Machine competitions, because the idea of being overcome by <ins>that which we’ve created</ins> speaks to something very deep within our collective consciousness.

    <p>Mastering the Game of Go with Deep Neural Networks and Tree Search. The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence due to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. Put another way, winning at Go is a kind of Holy Grail for those who strive to create machines that can “think” on their own, because success at this uniquely complex game seems to require something more than:
    <ul>
    <li>just skill;</li>
    <li>knowledge;</li>
    <li>experience.</li>
  </ul>
